# Problem Statement:
Fragmented logistics data, involving multiple hubs and sub-hubs, requires consolidation into streamlined source-to-destination records. Additionally, discrepancies between OSRM-estimated and actual time/distance impact customer satisfaction and revenue, highlighting the need for accurate predictions and operational optimizations.
# Data Cleaning & Integration: 
Processed and consolidated complex logistics data by grouping multiple data points into single source-to-destination records, ensuring cleaner and more manageable datasets for analysis.
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Analyzed key trends and patterns in delivery performance, including significant differences between OSRM-estimated and actual time/distance parameters.
# Hypothesis Testing & Insights: 
Identified critical insights, such as the impact of time/distance deviations on customer satisfaction, purchase behavior, and revenue, with high activity observed in states
